If you're down a piece or a pawn but your opponent has a bishop, remember that you can still hope for a draw in an endgame with pawnitisation.

Those are the basics of pawnitisation. In the next post, we'll look at slightly more involved examples and the "strange exceptions" - positions where breaking pawnitisation is possible!

And lastly, for readers who haven't felt sufficiently challenged by the material in the post, I've prepared the following position, which features ideas not presented above. White to play; does black hold, or can white somehow win?

{{< fen-diag caption="White to move. Can white win?" fen="1k6/3p3p/2p2pp1/8/8/5P1P/1P1P2P1/2B3K1 w - - 0 1">}}
